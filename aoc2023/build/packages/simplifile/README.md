Simplifile provides basic file operations (read, write, append, and delete) that work
for all targets (Erlang, Node, and Deno). It also provides functions for working with directories.

Note: When upgrading versions, be sure to check the changelog. 

## Example
```gleam
let filepath = "./test/hello.txt"
let assert Ok(_) = "Hello, World" |> write(to: filepath)
let assert Ok(_) = "Goodbye, Mars" |> append(to: filepath)
let assert Ok("Hello, WorldGoodbye, Mars") = read(from: filepath)
let assert Ok(_) = delete(filepath)
let assert Error(_) = read(from: filepath)
```

## Installation

If available on Hex this package can be added to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add simplifile
```

and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/simplifile>.
